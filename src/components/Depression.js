      <h1>Missionary Depression Resources</h1>
      <p className="p">
        Missionary work and the conditions associated with it can be
        discouraging. Sometimes in our lives, we may even fall in a state of
        constant sadness. Just remember: God sees every tear, and He has the
        power to comfort you. Your family and friends are praying for you.
        You're never alone. Feeling this way, we recommend you talk to someone
        you trust, like your mission president or companion, or get the help you
        need.
